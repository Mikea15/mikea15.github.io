		Hi! I'm Michael Adaixo, I'm a game programmer. This is a space where I
		write about game development, programming in general, computer graphics,
		and any other topic I deem interesting.
	</p>

	<p>
		I once won awards for making [robot-shopping-carts follow you using a
		Microsoft Kinect and Motorized
		Wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhHXldpknC4). Working on image
		recognition and PID controllers, among other things.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have experience in C++, C#, HLSL and swift languages. Most of my time
		is spent working in C# with Unity. I’m proficient with Unity and am
		learning Unreal Engine at full speed. I’ve released 3 mobile games at
		SkyBelow Studios.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe anyone can become or do anything, given time, motivation and
		passion. This is why I never stop learning and am always trying to solve
		challenging problems.
