## Description

FlowPilot is an Unreal Engine code plugin that allows simple, modular and extensible gameplay flow creation. 
Using a data driven approach you can create gameplay very easily by re-using existing Tasks or FlowPilot Assets entirely. 
Provided with a custom FlowPilotEditor, making new sequences, interactive objects or scripted scenes is a breeze!

## Features

- Simple `FlowPilotTask` can be created in Blueprint and C++
- `FlowPilotComponent` controls FlowPilot Execution and is fully exposed to Blueprint.
- Re-usability at its core with modular data-driven approach
- Re-use identical flows by grouping them into another `FlowPilot Asset`
- Easily find actors in the level or at runtime via GameplayTags
- Prefetch actors for fast and efficient access with caching handled by `FlowPilotSystemComponent`
- Debugging Tools: CPU Profiling in code, Visual Logs, and ScopedCycles to stay on top of Performance
- FlowPilot Editor makes it a breeze to quickly edit your flows
- Included `FlowPilotTasks` will have you going in no time
- Automatic Spawned Actor lifetime management
