## Description

FlowPilot is a simple, modular and extensible gameplay system that allows fast data-driven gameplay flow creation.
FlowPilot tasks are at the core of the functionality, much like behavior trees use BTTasks, FlowPilot uses FPTasks.

FPTasks can be created in Cpp and Blueprint to allow maximum flexibility.

## Features

- Create FPTasks in Cpp and/or Blueprint
- Easy FlowPilotComponent execution control
- Re-usability at its code with modular data-driven approach
- Group sections into their own FlowPilot Data assets
- GameplayTag-based actor reference search and prefetch caching system
- Integrated CPU Profiling Traces, Visual Logs and ScopedCycles to stay on top of Performance
- Easy debug utilities to know what it going on at any time
- Many pre-built FPTasks to get you going (Sequence, Selector, Parallel, Loop, Delay, Spawn, Despawn, Load Level, and more)
