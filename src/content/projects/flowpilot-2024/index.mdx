## Description

FlowPilot is an Unreal Engine code plugin that allows simple, modular and extensible gameplay flow. Using a data driven approach and with a custom 
editor, you can create fast gameplay flow, scripted sequences, interactive object. 

All without the clutter that can sometimes happen when dealing with Blueprints.
FlowPilot uses Tasks which are re-usable modules that run logic code. These can be created in Cpp and in Blueprint.

## Features

- Simple Modules `FlowPilotTask` can be created in Blueprint and C++
- FlowPilotComponent controls FlowPilot Execution and is fully exposed to Blueprint.
- Re-usability at its core with modular data-driven approach
- Re-use identical flows by grouping them into another FlowPilot Asset
- Easily find actors in the level, or at runtime via GameplayTags
- Prefetch and caching handled by FlowPilotSystemComponent
- Debugging Tools: CPU Profiling in code, Visual Logs, and ScopedCycles to stay on top of Performance
- Easy editing with a custom FlowPilot editor
- Pre-built list of FlowPilotTasks include: Sequences, Selectors, Parallel, Loop, Delay, Spawn, FlowPilotExecution, and more.
