I'm learning Zig! If you're new here, Zig is a programming language! 

Why tho? 
FlowPilot needs a documentation website so that users can easily find and read about FlowPilot. Most importantly, good reference.
When programming FlowPilot I comment relevant info in the code, but that's mostly only visible to programmers. 

Zig comes to the rescue with an automated code reader, that extracts info and writes it into the documentation page. 

Success.
