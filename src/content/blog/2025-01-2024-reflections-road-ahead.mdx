## Looking back at 2024

As I try to look into what to learn in 2025, I am obliged to look back at what I worked on last year. Last year started being hyper focused on [FlowPilot](/projects/flowpilot-2024) development and trying to flush as many things as I could to make it the best it could be and eventually launched in the Epic Marketplace (now Fab).

While making that, I managed to learn a bit about [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language when I tried to make a documentation parser with it. Which leads to a secondary project related to FlowPilot. [FlowPilot.Dev](https://www.flowpilot.dev) documentation website is a static website made with [Astro.build](https://astro.build/). 

I wanted to make something that read a few Cpp header files and export the metadata from each structure, classes, enums, comments, functions etc into a Markdown file, and move those files into the doc website automatically. I also added a way to preserve manually placed documentation with custom delimiters on the page. The Project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Mikea15/go-cpp-mk).

I didn't do this in Zig tho, I pivoted to GoLang. It was my first experience with GoLang too and found it very nice to use and learn. Last year was the year I dived into ChatGPT and Claude.ai, and using those to learn Zig and Go where instrumental. They are very good tools to learn existing tech. 

By october I was working on a side project in Unreal Engine to automatically generate cover locations based off of NavMesh Edges from the NavMesh. I made some progress but this project will have to be placed on hold for now as I have new interests.

Late in the year, I revisited my Boids system and decided I should try to use compute shaders to make it run a lot faster. A few iterations with Claude.ai and I had a base Compute shader running [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/Mikea15/7afb75fa1bd61aba24819cce90e9d184), and after a couple of days, 100k space-partitioned Boids being simulated on the GPU. Very happy about that one. Can't wait to explore more of this.

## Goals for 2025

This year I want to focus more on two topics I hold close to my heart: AI and Performance. 

On the AI side of things, I've already started to read up and make a demo about GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning), I have something running but will need to expand it to a real use case scenario to deepen my knowledge. 

Another AI topic is Neural Networks. They are all the rage lately and I don't know as much as I'd like, so that's on my list as well. 

On the Performance side of things, I don't have a clear project or goal aside from having bought a [SuperLuminal](https://superluminal.eu) license and profiling anything and everything I've made. I see myself exploring more of Unreal's Multithreading primitives and Compute Shaders as well.

Aside from that, it would be nice if I could do a small project in Zig. Maybe a super tiny game? We'll see.

## All in All

### 2024

- [FlowPilot](/projects/flowpilot-2024) released in Epic Marketplace / Fab
- [Cpp-To-MD](https://github.com/Mikea15/go-cpp-mk): Documentation exporter for Unreal Projects
- Intro to [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
- Intro to Go Lang
- Intro to Compute Shaders.

### 2025

- Continue exploring GOAP.
- Explore Neural Networks.
- Profile all the things
- Make and release a tiny game.
- Continue learning [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

Goals are set!! Let's see how many of these I can follow through. I'll be happy with doing at least 3 of them.

Cheers.
