title: 'Where is my FlowPilot running from'

FlowPilot is not visible in the editor currently. There's no visual cue, only by running the game, you'll know there's FlowPilot assets running. So lets fix that.

One way to show things on screen is have `UFlowPilotComponent` inherit from `FComponentVisualizer`, so lets implement it.

```cpp
class FLOWPILOT_API UFlowPilotComponent 
    : public UActorComponent
    , public FComponentVisualizer
```

Adding `FComponentVisualizer` prompts me to include `UnrealEd` into my public project dependencies, which I accept and move on to discover what this class has to offer in terms of overridable interfaces.

```c#
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(
    new string[]
    {
        "Core", 
        "UnrealEd"
    }
);
```
This method looks promissing. I'll want to have a simple display when the component is attached to an actor on the scene, so this should allow me to draw even if the actor isn't selected.
```cpp
/** Draw visualization for the supplied component */
virtual void DrawVisualization(const UActorComponent* Component, const FSceneView* View, FPrimitiveDrawInterface* PDI) {}
```
