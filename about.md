Hi! I'm Michael Adaixo, I'm a game programmer.
This is a space where I write about game development, programming in general, computer graphics, and any other topic I deem interesting.

I once won awards for making [robot-shopping-carts follow you using a Microsoft Kinect and Motorized Wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhHXldpknC4). Working on image recognition and PID controllers, among other things.

I have experience in C++, C#, HLSL and swift languages. Most of my time is spent working in C# with Unity. I’m proficient with Unity and am learning Unreal Engine at full speed. I’ve released 3 mobile games at SkyBelow Studios.

I believe anyone can become or do anything, given time, motivation and passion. This is why I never stop learning and am always trying to solve challenging problems.

Check out my [projects here]({{ '../projects' | relative_path }}).
