So I could not finish, Algorithms I and II and Cryptography I and II because of work and my masters degree. But I enlisted to two other courses, that will be happening on my "masters vacations". I'm still working 8+ hours a day, but I don't have to study for exams now. :)

So I'm taking two interesting courses at coursera. First one is "Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story" and the other, maybe the one I will pay more attention because I really think I need it, "Startup Engineering".

So far so good. I'm keeping up! :D
