Hello![<img loading="lazy" src="http://mikeadev.net/wp-content/uploads/unity.jpg" alt="" title="unity" width="225" height="225" class="alignright size-full wp-image-34" srcset="http://mikeadev.net/wp-content/uploads/unity.jpg 225w, http://mikeadev.net/wp-content/uploads/unity-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />](http://mikeadev.net/wp-content/uploads/unity.jpg)

So in the past month, I&#8217;ve been progressing a lot in game development, mainly with XNA, making a 3D game using Kinect (you) as the game controller. Things weren&#8217;t easy. Mainly because I&#8217;m starting to think XNA sucks.

So, I&#8217;ve watched over 15hours of Unity Training form all over the web (3dBuzz), and found out that Unity is AWESOME! I am already working on a new game, with Unity + Kinect :), but that&#8217;s for work.

Now for me, next month, is October, and @LudumDare October means a [new Challenge](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/09/27/announcing-october-challenge-2012/)! So basically, make a game, publish it, make a dollar. Seems fair. :) 

That pretty much sums it up. I&#8217;m gonna make a game, and try to monetize it :)

PS: Unity is awesome. <3
