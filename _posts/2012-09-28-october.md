Hello!

[<img class="img-fluid " src="http://mikeadev.net/content/img/unity.jpg" alt="" title="unity"/>](http://mikeadev.net/content/img/unity.jpg)

So in the past month, I've been progressing a lot in game development, mainly with XNA, making a 3D game using Kinect (you) as the game controller. Things weren't easy. Mainly because I'm starting to think XNA sucks.

So, I've watched over 15hours of Unity Training form all over the web (3dBuzz), and found out that Unity is AWESOME! I am already working on a new game, with Unity + Kinect :), but that's for work.

Now for me, next month, is October, and @LudumDare October means a [new Challenge](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/09/27/announcing-october-challenge-2012/)! So basically, make a game, publish it, make a dollar. Seems fair. :) 

That pretty much sums it up. I'm gonna make a game, and try to monetize it :)

PS: Unity is awesome. <3
