Hey!

So this couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been mostly working on my Thesis, or at least should have been. But the urge of making games has lead me off track. I&#8217;ve participated in two gamejams: #candyjam , to protest against King.com and #flappyjam , to support Flappy Bird&#8217;s creator.

#candyjam wasn&#8217;t that great for me, I was able to make something, but its no fun really, and the artwork wasn&#8217;t made by me. 

On the other end, #flappyjam was really nice to make. I&#8217;ve made all assets and ended up making a clone of flappy bird under a week. My theme of choice was Final Fantasy, hence the name Final Flapasy, so I&#8217;ve made a chocobo for the player and some cactuars as the enemies. I hope you like it.

You can play the game for free either at [itch.io](http://mikea15.itch.io/final-flapasy) or [gamejolt.com](http://gamejolt.com/games/action/final-flapasy/22921/) , and you can play it on your Android phone or tablet for free, obviously. Just follow the link to [download it for android](http://bit.ly/1bxPOYz) .

The game is still buggy, and it has no catchy tune, but I&#8217;ll keep updating it if enough persons like it and play it. :)

If you like the game, please share it with your friends and family :)

Now back to the &#8220;serious&#8221; work. :)  
Cheers.
