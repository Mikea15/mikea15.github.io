Hey!

So this couple of weeks, I've been mostly working on my Thesis, or at least should have been. But the urge of making games has lead me off track. I've participated in two gamejams: #candyjam , to protest against King.com and #flappyjam , to support Flappy Bird's creator.

#candyjam wasn't that great for me, I was able to make something, but its no fun really, and the artwork wasn't made by me. 

On the other end, #flappyjam was really nice to make. I've made all assets and ended up making a clone of flappy bird under a week. My theme of choice was Final Fantasy, hence the name Final Flapasy, so I've made a chocobo for the player and some cactuars as the enemies. I hope you like it.

You can play the game for free either at [itch.io](http://mikea15.itch.io/final-flapasy) or [gamejolt.com](http://gamejolt.com/games/action/final-flapasy/22921/) , and you can play it on your Android phone or tablet for free, obviously. Just follow the link to [download it for android](http://bit.ly/1bxPOYz) .

The game is still buggy, and it has no catchy tune, but I'll keep updating it if enough persons like it and play it. :)

If you like the game, please share it with your friends and family :)

Now back to the "serious" work. :)  
Cheers.
