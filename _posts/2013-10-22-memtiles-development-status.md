## We are on the final stretch!

The last art assets are being made. The 3D models are being updated and polished. The sound is being adjusted, and the game is being play tested on many different devices by many different people to make sure everything works fine when launching.

So right now is the most crucial part, the last tiny bits of detail that need to be polished. By the end of the week, the game will be in its final form, ready to launch. But first, I&#8217;m going to have to make some promotional stuff, like videos, image headers and icons, set up a website, and write a &#8220;press release&#8221; to send to blogs for possible reviews in order to advertise the game.

It&#8217;s been a long ride and hopefully all continues well as I have more games in mind to make :)

The game is going to be released for Android devices first, then maybe iOS and WP8, for both mobile phones and tablets. Maybe later on I&#8217;ll release a web build but for now, this is the plan.

Cheers :)
