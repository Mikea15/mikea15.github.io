Memtiles Kids has been released!

We've finally packed the whole thing, polished the last details, and submitted the game to the Google Play Store. You can now [purchase and download Memtiles Kids for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MichaelAdaixo.MemTilesKids).

It features four unique themes: Colors, Numbers, Shapes and Animals. Play through 180 different and randomly generated levels and challenge your memory!

iOS and Windows 8 releases are expected in the next two weeks, so if you want the game for these platforms, bear with us just a little longer :)

Cheers
