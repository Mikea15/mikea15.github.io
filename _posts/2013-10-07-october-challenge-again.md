Last year I posted quite enthusiastly that I was going to participate in Ludum Dare&#8217;s october challenge, which is &#8220;Finish a game — Take it to market — Earn $1&#8221;. 

Back when I posted that, I had just found was Unity3D was and was amazed of how quickly I could do game prototypes. As you may know, I&#8217;m developing Memtiles and although I would love to say that I&#8217;m really in this year, it might be complicated. Anyway, [Ludum Dare&#8217;s October Challenge](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/09/27/october-challenge-2013/) is up again, so go for it!

I&#8217;ve aimed the end of the month to release the game. If everything goes according to plan, I&#8217;m going to have all the artwork ready, music, and gameplay. Then I release it, and make a marketing plan to advertise it. So I might not be making my first $1 this month, but hey, at least I&#8217;ll be finishing my first game :)

PS: As soon as I have the final artwork, I&#8217;ll post some more screenshots. :) I can already say that the games looks nothing like the Beta version. :) Its much, much better :)
