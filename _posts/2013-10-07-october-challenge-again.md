Last year I posted quite enthusiastly that I was going to participate in Ludum Dare's october challenge, which is "Finish a game — Take it to market — Earn $1". 

Back when I posted that, I had just found was Unity3D was and was amazed of how quickly I could do game prototypes. As you may know, I'm developing Memtiles and although I would love to say that I'm really in this year, it might be complicated. Anyway, [Ludum Dare's October Challenge](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/09/27/october-challenge-2013/) is up again, so go for it!

I've aimed the end of the month to release the game. If everything goes according to plan, I'm going to have all the artwork ready, music, and gameplay. Then I release it, and make a marketing plan to advertise it. So I might not be making my first $1 this month, but hey, at least I'll be finishing my first game :)

PS: As soon as I have the final artwork, I'll post some more screenshots. :) I can already say that the games looks nothing like the Beta version. :) Its much, much better :)
