I'm currently taking a online course at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" title="Coursera" target="_blank">coursera</a>. Algorithms part I, from Princeton University. I was undergoing a similar course from Standford, but I couldn't keep up with classes because I was participating on the Imagine Cup 2012 in Sydney.

So I'll be learning a whole new stuff, and hopefully I'll bring some of the knowledge I'll learn and make some tutorials, and give up samples. :)

Feel free to join, it's free! :)
