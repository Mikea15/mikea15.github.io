I&#8217;m currently taking a online course at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" title="Coursera" target="_blank">coursera</a>. Algorithms part I, from Princeton University. I was undergoing a similar course from Standford, but I couldn&#8217;t keep up with classes because I was participating on the Imagine Cup 2012 in Sydney.

So I&#8217;ll be learning a whole new stuff, and hopefully I&#8217;ll bring some of the knowledge I&#8217;ll learn and make some tutorials, and give up samples. :)

Feel free to join, it&#8217;s free! :)
